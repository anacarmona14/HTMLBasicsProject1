        <h2>A very brief piece of history</h2>

        <p><strong>The internet</strong> is a revolutionary technology that has transformed the way we communicate, work,
            and access information. The internet as we know it today did not exist in the 1950s. Computers were mostly large,
            expensive machines used by government agencies, research institutions, and a few large corporations at the time.
            There was no global network connecting these computers, and the concept of a public internet was decades away.
            However, during the 1950s Cold War, the US government began to investigate ways to develop a secure communications
            system capable of withstanding a nuclear attack, which resulted in our first steps towards creating a cyberspace.
            Although the main focus of this website is exploring the Internet of the 90s and early 2000s, let's take a quick look
            at its <em>history</em> and appreciate how far we have come.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>As previously mentioned, the US government started looking into ways to develop a secure communications
                system around the <strong>1950s.</strong></li>
            <li>During the <strong>late 60s</strong> the world's first computer network called ARPANET was developed by 
                the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense as a result of previous research.
                <br>It was the first wide-area packet-switching network that connected university and military computers across the
                US.</li>
            <li>During the <strong>70s</strong>, Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, two of "the fathers of the Internet", created the
                Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) that the ARPANET adopted, allowing computers on various networks to communicate with
                one another and laying the foundation for the modern internet.</li>
            <li>In the <strong>1980s</strong>, the National Science Foundation (NSF) developed the NSFNET, which replaced the ARPANET
                and connected even more universities and research centers across the US.
                <br>This network was later upgraded to the 'T-1 backbone', which allowed for faster data transfer speeds.</li>
            <li>During the <strong>late 80s</strong> and <strong>early 1990s</strong>, The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee,
                a British computer scientist also known as one of "the fathers of the Internet".
                <br>The WWW enabled users to access information from all over the globe.
                With millions of users worldwide by the <strong>early 2000s</strong>, the internet had established itself as a global phenomenon.

                target="_blank">In a 2011 interview, 
                Berner explained that:</a> "Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very 
                difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the internet, 
                multi-font text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What did the internet look like before?</h2>
        
        <p>The internet has evolved dramatically over the past several decades, and thanks to the <em>Wayback Machine</em> from
            <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank"> Archive.org</a> and the Internet community,
            we can take a trip down memory lane and see how the internet used to look like in the past.
            Let's take a look at some iconic websites from the 90s and early 2000s to learn about
            their design and content trends.</p>
