        <h2> Early 90s - The first website ever published and the beginning of the web as we know it</h2>

        <p>Tim Berners-Lee and his team launched the world's first web page on August 6, 1991. This modest page, hosted on a
            NeXT computer at CERN, contained information about the World Wide Web and how to create web sites. There were no
            graphic components on these text-only websites. The first web browser, also created by Tim Berners-Lee, was
            called <em>WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus)</em>. It was a graphical browser launched on 1990 that ran on the
            NeXTSTEP operating system and allowed users to create and edit web pages as well as browse them.</p>

        <p>Another early browser was the <em>Line Mode Browser</em>, created by Nicola Pellow in 1991. It was a text-based
            browser that allowed users to browse the web without requiring a graphical interface.</p>

        <p>Other early web browsers included <em>Mosaic (see screenshot below)</em>, which was released in 1993 and was the first browser to
            display images inline with text, and <em>Netscape Navigator</em>, which was released in 1994 and became the
            <br>
            dominant browser of the mid-1990s.</p>

        <h2>Mid 90s and early 2000s - Graphic browsers and the era of JavaScript + CSS + Flash</h2>

        <p>As previously mentioned, graphic browsers, such as Netscape Navigator, Mosaic and the infamous Internet Explorer,
            began to overtake text-based browsers, allowing graphics and more visually pleasing webpages to emerge. This
            enabled designers to develop more sophisticated websites, and consumers to interact with web material in a more
            natural manner. JavaScript and CSS were introduced as the perfect complement for HTML websites, along with the
            Flash elements that characterized the 2000s. JavaScript enabled the development of interactive web content such
            as pop-up windows, drop-down menus, and other features. CSS, on the other hand, gave designers more control over
            how web information was displayed, making it easier to construct more visually pleasing websites with uniform
            layouts.
            <br><br>
            Graphical landing and home pages like the following started to proliferate. Its purpose was to welcome the
            user, direct it somewhere and/or facilitate navigation</p>

                <p>As the internet evolved and more people had access to it, the possibilities for web design and development
                expanded. <em>Netscape Navigator</em> and <em>Internet Explorer</em> dominated the era by supporting animated gifs,
                text formatting and tables. JS and the newly introduced CSS (1996) allowed us to create interactive websites, lateral menus,
                separated content, interactive websites with page and 3d effects, saturated colorful backgrounds, and more.
                This era was a <strong>breakthrough moment</strong>, laying the groundwork for the rich and varied web experiences we
                have today.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Macromedia Flash was a multimedia software platform introduced in the mid-1990s. Its use in website design grew in the early 2000s because it enabled
                the creation of animated content, such as games, banners, and menus. Flash was discontinued due to its incompatibility with mobile devices and
                vulnerability to security threats.</p>
